# Pet Project

This project requires a bunch of installations.

Linux/Mac

Python and pip are already installed. Make a virtual environment and install all the packages there. 

Windows

Install git, Python 3.11 and Visual Studio Code. Make sure to add git to the PATH. This will be asked during the installation. Other versions of Python may give problems.

- [ ] Complete a full installation of OpenGate on Mac
- [ ] Complete a full installation of OpenGate on Windows

- [ ] Make PowerPoint presentation that displays all the capabilities of the code
- [ ] Write a draft of the entire assignment
